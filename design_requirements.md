# App

CV App is a React project, where I want to put together the knowledge and skills I've been learning in the UI/UX side of things:

- Accessibility
- Responsive Design
- Error handling: **validation** / **messages**
- Animations and transitions
- Component design

## UX

CV App is a **dynamic** and **interactive** web application that allows you build a cv/resume. It is a test ground for playing and experimenting. I want the app to be **intuitive**, **simple**, **not limitative**, and self explaining.

## UI Design

I want it to look **modern** and **minimalist**, I want to incorpore a **colorful** palette, modern **gradients**, smooth **animations** and **transitions**. I want the **components** of the UI to _stand out_, and be recognizable as they all come together for a beautiful UI.

### Visual requirements

- Colorful palette
- Modern gradients
- Smooth animations and transitions
- UI components stand out

### Page structure

The page is structured with the following sections:

- Header
- Input section, with the input fields
- View section, displays the cv

## Accessibility

I want to incorpore accessibility features, making the page semantic, keyboard accessible, and meaningful in guiding the user of what it is required to do.

- Semantic html
- Compatible with assistive technologies
- Keyboard navigation, tab order, hidden content
- Accessible colors and contrast ratio
- Meaningful text
- Alternative text
- Highlight required fields, links in new tab
- Accessible forms
- WAI-ARIA (_No_ ARIA is better than _bad_ ARIA)
- Aria: label, labelledby, describedby and hidden
- Favor user preferences and settings
- WCAG

## Responsive Design

Make it responsive. Suitable for mobile, tablets and desktop devices. Prioritizing natural html resposivenes, flexible items, and effective and efficient media queries.

- Mobile, Tablet and Desktop support
- Favor natural responsiveness, min-height, max-width, avoiding heights
- Use of relative units: rem, em, percentages and viewport units

# Error handling: validation / messages

Validate user input, implementing real-time validation on selected components, to favor user experience and minimize renders

- Validate user input
- Real-time validation on selected sensible components
- Meaningful feedback: clear descriptive messages, descriptive colors, and meaningful placement

## Animations and transitions

Use animation to boost the user experience, providing value not only by how they look, but as a tool to guide the user through your interface

- Visual pleasing transitions, looks sick
- Instructive animations, to guide the user
- Action-driven animations, represent actions

## Component design

This is a React project, so practice and favor Components, and combine controlled and uncontrolled components to achieve a pleasing user experience
